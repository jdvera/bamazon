# BAMAZON, the New-and-Improved Amazon experience

## tl;dr Video Tutorial: 

##  This app has 3 interfaces: Customer, Manager, and Supervisor
### - Customers get a view of all items currently in stock and have the ability to buy them. If an item's stock quantity is (or becomes) 0, then the product no longer appears to the customer.  A customer cannot buy more of a product than what is in stock or choose an ID not associated with a product.

### - Managers have a few more options available to them:
####	"View Products for Sale" - This shows ALL products, even those with 0 stock.
####	"View Low Inventory" - This shows all products with stock lower than 5.
####	"Add to Inventory" - This allows the user to add stock to a product.
####	"Add New Product" - This allows the user to add a new product to the inventory, which Customers can then purchase.

### - Supervisors have two distinct options available:
####	"View Product Sales by Department" - This displays the total sales for all products, organized by department.
####	"Create New Department" - This allows the user to add a new department, which Managers can then add new products to.
